# DTML-Retail-Analysis
This project was done in Microsoft Excel and Power BI just to do a comparison between the two tools on creating visualizations . The dashboard and reports were made with a retail sales dataset.
New columns were created to calculate for Revenue and Profit. A Pivot table and Pivot charts were used to create reports and dashboard in Excel. A textbox was used to show some insights.![POWER BI DASHBOARD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122671659/227729523-9926ed3c-697e-4452-ab2e-7e509d6f97ff.jpg)

Likewise, in Power Bi, analysis was carried out to gain further insights on the dataset. The dataset which was a spreadsheet file, was imported, cleaned, loaded and transformed.
